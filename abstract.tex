The aim of this research was to design and implement an observer to estimate the state of a rigid cube from sparse range measurements. This was motivated by active research in the development of a design methodology for symmetry-preserving, infinite dimensional observers. The simplified cube estimation problem serves as a first step in this research direction, investigating the use of a sparse sensor in dense estimation and identifying effective innovation functions for rigid body state estimation. 

A Matlab toolbox was developed to simulate measurements of rigid bodies by a Hokuyo UBG-04LX-F01 scanning laser range-finder. This simulation was used to assess the performance of the observer. Experimental data was collected to more realistically simulate the error distribution of the sensor and for future testing of observers under real-world conditions. 

The simulation results show that the observer...
