This thesis concerns mobile robot localisation and mapping through the use of the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). An EKF is used to integrate an Inertial Navigation System and a Global Satellite Navigation system. The computational requirements of the EKF are reduced using with a compressed design. Simulations using simulated and real data are conducted to test the accuracy, robustness and computational efficiency of the designs.
