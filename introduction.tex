\chapter{Introduction}

autonomous robots, unstructured environments. Advances in hardware - need improvements in software to fully utilise capabilities of dense sensors.
	What is needed is observer design methodology.
MOTIVATION\\
	Allow for improved convergence, global. 
RESEARCH     GOALS\\
	Exploratory, look into sparse sensor - dense measurements. Build an observer for an infinite dimensional system - in this case, simplified at first. Will explore if infinite dimensional, symmetry preserving implementation would improve performance
WHAT IS IN REPORT\\
	This report presents the implementation of an observer to solve a novel problem: estimating
	Simulation - to test performance, experimental validation
	
	implementation of an observer to solve novel problem - sparse sensor gives dense measurement.
	Sparse measurements from a range sensor
	dense measurement part of new direction of research into infinite dimensional symmetry preserving observers.
	Section \ref{litreview} reviews literature infinite dimensional observers. Looks at methods for design.
	Relevant background for ... symmetry, state representation. Lie groups. 
	Present problem - detailed breakdown, how it fits into lit. 
	Detailed description of simulation implementation including observer update function design.
	Chapter 
	experimental data - noise model + measurements collected
