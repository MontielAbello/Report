\chapter{Introduction}

Advances in manufacturing and hardware design have made mobile robots more accessible - not only for research and industrial purposes, but to the general public. However, autonomous robots have largely been limited to indoor, carefully controlled environments. Dense sensors such as light field cameras are becoming cheaper and lighter, promising to allow autonomous robots to acquire detailed measurements of complex environments. To fully utilise the potential of these advancing technologies,  improvements in observer design are required to generate more accurate and detailed descriptions of these environments from dense measurements.

One method of estimating the state of an complex environment is with an infinite-dimensional observer. Typically, observers for infinite-dimensional systems are extensions of finite dimensional Luenberger observers. Unfortunately, this design approach is only able to guarantee convergence for linear systems. Developing a theory of symmetry-preserving, infinite-dimensional observers would simplify the design process for nonlinear systems and result in observers with improved convergence properties.
