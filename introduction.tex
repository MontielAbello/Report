\chapter{Introduction}

Advances in hardware have made mobile robots more accessible for research, industry and even to the general public. Dense sensors such as .... are becoming cheaper, smaller. Before robots can be deployed autonomously in complex, real-world environment, need improvements in software to fully utilise capabilities of dense sensors.

MOTIVATION\\
	One method observe environment - infinite dimensional observer. 
	Current theory for infinite dimensional observer design lacking. Typically extensions of luenberger type observers for finite dimensional systems which don't work well for nonlinear systems.
	Developing a theory of symmetry preserving infinite dimensional observers would allow for improved/easier design with for improved convergence properties, global convergence. 
RESEARCH GOALS\\
	Exploratory, look into sparse sensor - dense measurements. Build an observer for an infinite dimensional system - in this case, simplified at first. Will explore if infinite dimensional, symmetry preserving implementation would improve performance
WHAT IS IN REPORT\\
	This report presents the implementation of an observer to solve a novel problem: estimating cube state from sparse range measurements.
	Simulation - to test performance, experimental validation
	
	implementation of an observer to solve novel problem - sparse sensor gives dense measurement.
	Sparse measurements from a range sensor
	dense measurement part of new direction of research into infinite dimensional symmetry preserving observers.
	Section \ref{sec:literature} reviews literature infinite dimensional observers. Looks at methods for design.
	Relevant background for ... symmetry, state representation. Lie groups. 
	Present problem - detailed breakdown, how it fits into lit. 
	Detailed description of simulation implementation including observer update function design.
