\chapter{Introduction}
OVERVIEW OF RESEARCH, REPORT:\\
	implementation of an observer to solve novel problem - sparse sensor gives dense measurement.
	dense measurement part of new direction of research into infinite dimensional symmetry preserving observers.
CONTEXT\\
	autonomous robots, unstructured environments. Advances in hardware - need improvements in software to fully utilise capabilities of dense sensors.
	What is needed is observer design methodology.
MOTIVATION\\
	Allow for improved convergence, global. 
RESEARCH GOALS\\
	Exploratory, look into sparse sensor - dense measurements. Build an observer for an infinite dimensional system - in this case, simplified at first. Will explore if infinite dimensional, symmetry preserving implementation would improve performance
WHAT IS IN REPORT\\
	Review of literature\\
	Relevant background\\
	simulation implementation\\
	observer design\\
	experimental data - noise model + measurements collected
