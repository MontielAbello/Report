\chapter{Introduction}
OVERVIEW OF RESEARCH, REPORT:\\
	implementation of an observer to solve novel problem - sparse sensor gives dense measurement.
	dense measurement part of new direction of research into infinite dimensional symmetry preserving observers.
CONTEXT\\
	autonomous robots, unstructured environments. Advances in hardware - need improvements in software to fully utilise capabilities of dense sensors.
	What is needed is observer design methodology.
MOTIVATION\\
	Allow for improved convergence, global. 
RESEARCH GOALS\\
	Exploratory, look into sparse sensor - dense measurements. Build an observer for an infinite dimensional system - in this case, simplified at first. Will explore if infinite dimensional, symmetry preserving implementation would improve performance
WHAT IS IN REPORT\\
	Review of literature\\
	Relevant background\\
	simulation implementation\\
	observer design\\
	experimental data - noise model + measurements collected


FROM MARKING CRITERIA
The introduction orients the reader to your report. It should present the
nature and scope of the problem in terms of applications to 'real world'
problems (what motivates the study); refer briefly to associated and
relevant literature already published; state the method of investigation (the
main technical issues, including important limitations in scope); and
describe the report that follows (a sort of road-map, so that the reader
knows what's to come).
