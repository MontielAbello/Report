refer back to context, literature, motivation\\

implemented observer - dense sensor.\\
results promising - dense sensor capable of observing infinite dimensional system\\
implementation reveals limitations of finite dimensional, non-invariant design method - position and orientation don't work well together\\
shows that new research into invariant design is promising avenue of research, clear ways to solve problems encountered with this implementation
